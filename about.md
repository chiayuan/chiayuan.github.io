<em>As a software developer,</em><br>
<em>I think it's better to make some footprints on the Internet, right?</em>

<p>
I like to solve problems systematically; therefore, I seize every opportunity to make myself a better developer while reading and coding. I earned my Master's and Bachelor's degree from National Chiao Tung University and joined Bridgwell Inc. as a software developer in 2019</p>

<h2>A Little More About Me</h2>
<p>Besides from coding, I am quite a hipster (in a good way I supposed). 
I enjoy everything about stationery, such as fountain pens, notebooks or stamps. 
Although, as a minimalist with pride, I collect what I really need rather than everything I wanted.
Two of my favorite brands are Apple and Muji.

I am also a big fan of music (mostly from western). When I was young, I was crazy about pop music.
Nowadays, indie music is more to my taste. Some of my favorite singers/bands are: The National, The Radio Dept, Bon Iver, Lorde.
One of songs that hits me hard is:<br>
